  "summary": "REQ-1 appears implemented by routing from Log empty-state to Dashboard with a one-time URL search flag that auto-opens the Add Entry dialog and then clears the flag. REQ-2 appears implemented by adding a daily limit progress section on Dashboard using a Progress UI component and over-limit messaging (over-limit visual styling cannot be fully confirmed due to truncation). REQ-3 appears implemented by removing placeholder social links and rendering icons as non-clickable elements in the footer.",
